      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
        I am a digital archivist and media preservationist based in New York
        City. My research explores migration for audiovisual collections,
        open-source media workflows, preservation of software- and web-based
        art, and web3 technologies for audiovisual preservation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am the Research Fellow at the Digital Preservation Outreach &
        Education Network (DPOE-N) and Audio Preservation Intern at CUNY TV.
        Prior to this, I worked in digital preservation, film restoration, and
        media digitization at the Asian Film Archive in Singapore. I am
        currently pursuing an M.A. in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation
        (MIAP) at the Martin Scorsese Department of Cinema Studies, New York
        University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in Singapore and enjoy frequenting supermarkets in my free
        time.
