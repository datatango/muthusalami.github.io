      <p>Hello! I'm Matt Yang.</p>
      <p>
        I'm a digital archivist and media preservationist based in New York
        City. My work focuses on the migration of digital audiovisual
        collections, developing open-source media workflows, preserving software
        and web-based works, and leveraging web3 technologies for audiovisual
        preservation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am the Audio Preservation Technician at CUNY TV where I
        develop audio processing scripts for the Himan Brown Archives. Before
        this, I worked in digital preservation, film restoration, and media
        digitization at the Asian Film Archive in Singapore. I completed
        internships at the Bay Area Video Coalition, Cineric, CUNY TV, the New
        York Public Library, and Prelinger Archives during my graduate studies
        in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) at New York
        University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally from sunny Singapore, I enjoy walking down the aisles of
        supermarkets in my free time.
