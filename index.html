      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
        I am a digital archivist, media preservationist & technologist based in
        Los Angeles. My work focuses on the integration & migration of museum &
        archival collections, developing open-source data & media workflows, and
        preserving software & web-based works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am the Collection & Content Management Systems Graduate
        Intern at the J. Paul Getty Trust, where I develop digital preservation,
        video digitization, and web archiving workflows for Getty Digital (GDI).
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to this, I worked in digital preservation, film restoration, and
        media preservation at the Asian Film Archive in Singapore and CUNY TV in
        New York City. I have also completed internships at the Bay Area Video
        Coalition (BAVC), Cineric Inc., CUNY TV, the New York Public Library,
        and Prelinger Archives during my graduate studies in Moving Image
        Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) at the Tisch School of the Arts, New
        York University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally from sunny Singapore, I enjoy walking down supermarket aisles
        in my free time.
