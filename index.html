        Hello! I am an audiovisual archivist and preservationist based in New
        York City. My research explores microservices for audiovisual archives,
        open-source media workflows, and web3 technologies for audiovisual
        preservation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am Research Fellow at the Digital Preservation Outreach & Education
        Network (DPOE-N) and Digital Restoration Intern at Cineric Inc. Before
        this, I worked in film restoration, media digitization, and digital
        preservation at the Asian Film Archive in Singapore. I am currently
        pursuing an M.A. in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) at
        the Martin Scorsese Department of Cinema Studies, New York University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in Singapore and enjoy frequenting supermarkets in my free
        time.
