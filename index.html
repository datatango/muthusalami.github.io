      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
        I am a digital archivist and media preservationist based in New York
        City. My research explores migration for audiovisual collections,
        open-source media workflows, preservation of software- and web-based
        art, and web3 technologies for audiovisual preservation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently the Audio Preservation Intern at CUNY TV and a recent
        graduate of the Moving Image Archiving & Preservation (MIAP) Program at
        New York University, Tisch School of the Arts. Before this, I worked in
        digital preservation, film restoration, and media digitization at the
        Asian Film Archive in Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in sunny Singapore and enjoy frequenting supermarkets in my
        free time.
