      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
        I am a digital & media preservationist, and technologist based in Los
        Angeles. My work focuses on integrating and migrating museum and
        archival collections, designing open-source data and media workflows for
        cultural heritage preservation, and preserving web-based works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am the Collection & Content Management Systems Graduate
        Intern at the J. Paul Getty Trust and the Software Engineering Intern at
        the Internet Archive. At the Getty, I support its different programs in
        digital preservation, time-based media conservation, and web archiving,
        while at the Internet Archive, I develop bespoke tools to perform
        quality assurance on web archives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I worked in digital preservation, film restoration, and
        media preservation at the Asian Film Archive in Singapore and CUNY TV in
        New York City. I have also completed internships at the Bay Area Video
        Coalition (BAVC), Cineric Inc., CUNY TV, the New York Public Library,
        and Prelinger Archives during my graduate studies in Moving Image
        Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) at the Tisch School of the Arts, New
        York University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally from sunny Singapore, I enjoy grocery shopping, sailing, and
        hiking in my free time.
