      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
        I am a digital archivist and media preservationist based in Los Angeles.
        My work focuses on the migration of audiovisual collections, developing
        open-source media workflows, and preserving software & web-based works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am the Collection & Content Management Systems Graduate
        Fellow at the J. Paul Getty Trust, where I develop digital preservation,
        video digitization, and web archiving workflows for Getty Digital.
        Before this, I worked in digital preservation, film restoration, and
        media preservation at the Asian Film Archive in Singapore & CUNY TV in
        New York City. I also completed internships at the Bay Area Video
        Coalition (BAVC), Cineric Inc., CUNY TV, the New York Public Library,
        and Prelinger Archives during my graduate studies in Moving Image
        Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) at New York University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally from sunny Singapore, I enjoy walking down supermarket aisles
        in my free time.
