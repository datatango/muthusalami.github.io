      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
        I am a digital and media preservationist based in Chicago. My work centers on integrating and migrating museum and archival collections, building open-source data and media workflows for cultural heritage preservation, and preserving web-based works.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently am the Digital Preservation Specialist at the University of Chicago Library, where I contribute to UChicagoNode, an integrated digital collections platform that brings together digital materials across the Library's collections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I have worked in digital preservation, film restoration, and media preservation at institutions including the Asian Film Archive (Singapore), City University of New York Television (New York City), and the J. Paul Getty Trust (Los Angeles). I have also completed internships at Bay Area Video Coalition (BAVC), Cineric Inc., Internet Archive, New York Public Library (NYPL),
        and Prelinger Archives during my graduate studies in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally from sunny Singapore, I enjoy grocery shopping, sailing, and hiking in my free time.
