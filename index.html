      Hello! I am an audiovisual archivist and preservationist based in New York city. My research explores microservices for audiovisual archives, open-source media workflows, and web3 technologies for audiovisual preservation.

    <p>
      I am Research Fellow at the Digital Preservation Outreach & Education Network (DPOE-N) and Media Preservation Intern at the New York Public Library. I previously worked in film restoration, digitization, and digital preservation at the Asian Film Archive in Singapore and I am currently pursuing an M.A. in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) at New York University.

      I grew up in Singapore and enjoy frequenting supermarkets in my free time.
