      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
        I'm a digital and media preservationist and technologist based in Chicago. My work centers on integrating and migrating museum and archival collections, building open-source data and media workflows for cultural heritage preservation, and preserving web-based works.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently serve as the Digital Preservation Specialist at the University of Chicago Library, where I contribute to UChicagoNode, an integrated digital collections platform uniting digital materials from across the University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, Iâ€™ve worked in digital preservation, film restoration, and media preservation at institutions including the Asian Film Archive (Singapore), the J. Paul Getty Trust (Los Angeles), and CUNY TV (New York City). I have also completed internships at the Bay Area Video
        Coalition (BAVC), Cineric Inc., Internet Archive, the New York Public Library (NYPL),
        and Prelinger Archives during my graduate studies in Moving Image
        Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) at the Tisch School of the Arts, New
        York University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally from sunny Singapore, I enjoy grocery shopping, sailing, and
        hiking in my free time.
