      Hello! I am an audiovisual archivist and preservationist based in New York City. My research explores microservices for audiovisual archives, open-source media workflows, and web3 technologies for audiovisual preservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am Research Fellow at the Digital Preservation Outreach & Education Network (DPOE-N) and Media Preservation Intern at the New York Public Library. Prior to this, I worked in film restoration, media digitization, and digital preservation at the Asian Film Archive in Singapore. Additionally, I am currently pursuing an M.A. in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) at New York University, Tisch School of the Arts.

      I grew up in Singapore and enjoy frequenting supermarkets in my free time.
