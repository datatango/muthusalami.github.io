  Hey there! This page is included as an example. Feel free to customize it for your own use upon downloading. Carry on!

Celeste is a lightweight Jekyll theme that features a minimalist, content-first design. It places your content center stage and lets your readers view them in a clutter-free environment without visual distractions. It is based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll butler, by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

In addition to using Poole as its foundation, Celeste is also built using the following open-source projects:

* [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), a modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/), the iconic font and CSS toolkit.
* [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/), a collection of CSS3 powered hover effects.

Celeste is <i class="fa fa-code"></i> with <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> by [@nicoelayda](https://github.com/nicoelayda). Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/nicoelayda/celeste).
