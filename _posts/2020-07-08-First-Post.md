# Hello World!

The website is *finally* up and here is my first post!

I've been meaning to create a work site for awhile now and I've finally taken up the challenge after attending GA's Intro to Coding: HTML & CSS Workshop yesterday. It was a short webinar that covered the fundamentals, but enough for me to take the plunge. So here it is!

I initially considered Wordpress for its wide usage but ultimately chose a static site generator like **Jekyll**. Why? There were several reasons but quick deployment and less complexity were the main ones. It is by no means simple with my discover-as-you-go approach, but nothing that Google can't handle. At least for now.

The other great thing is static sites can be hosted directly on **GitHub** through a [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). That means 0 hosting fees and changes can be easily managed through versioning.

I've learned a lot throughout the process and there is plenty more to do. I'll update this page as I go along.
