The website is *finally* up and here is my first post!

I've been meaning to create a work site for awhile now and I've finally taken up the challenge after attending GA's Intro to Coding: HTML & CSS Workshop. It was a short webinar that covered the fundamentals, which taught me enough to take the plunge.

So here it is!

I initially considered Wordpress for its wide usage but ultimately chose a static site generator like **Jekyll** for its quick deployment and little complexity. Static sites can be hosted directly on **GitHub** through [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_ blank"}. That means no hosting fees (!!!) and easy management of edits, thanks to versioning (which I'm still discovering).

### Things I've learned and done so far

* How to purchase a domain [(namecheap)](https://namecheap.com/){:target="_ blank"} and point it to the host (**GitHub**)
* Discovered **GitHub** Desktop
* Better understand **GitHub** as a platform and its functions
* Set-up and create a simple **Jekyll** site and host it on **GitHub**
* How to host the site locally for testing
* How to maintain the entire project on **Atom**

There were some issues along the way, so I wouldn't say it was an easy ride. Fortunately, nothing is too difficult for Google & Stack Overflow. I've learned plenty so far but there is still much to do and learn. I'll update this page as I go along.
