This post will document the network component of my upcoming renovation of my new place. The place is around 20+ years old hence a major overhaul is required and the renovation is a great opportunity to lay CAT6 to all the rooms in the house for the 1Gbps network ðŸ¤“.

My research began with [this](https://www.patnotebook.com/bto-networking-singapore/) article on patnotebook.com detailing the conversion of telephone points to RJ45 data points in newer BTO (Build to Order) flats in Singapore. Newer flats in Singapore have CAT6 cables already nicely laid in the house, however, many of the points are terminated with a telephone jack. From the article, it seems that BTO flats only have one point terminated as RJ45, which is definitely not enough, especially with the current circumstances.

I will be updating this as I go but for now I've already made a simple diagram detailing the essential hardware required for the network setup. I've decided to go with Ubiquiti hardware for my first setup because it seems easy to put together for an 'enterprise' grade solution.
