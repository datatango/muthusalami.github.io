I have been meaning to go back into t-shirt printing after rediscovering cyanotype at my last summer internship.

I thought of stamps and decided to print one from Palestine as I've been deeply concerned about the violence in Gaza.

This stamp was issued in 1927 when Palestine was under civil administration of the British Mandate of Palestine. It depicts the dome of the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, which is widely considered Islam's third-holiest shrine. It was built between 691-692 CE and re-built between 1022-1023. Today, it is one of the world's oldest surviving works of Islamic architecture.

Israel controls all access to Al-Aqsa today and is reviewing possible curbs on access over the upcoming Ramadan fasting month. This compounds the clampdown it has placed on Palestinians in Gaza and beyond.

All suffering must end immediately. On that end, I hope to one day send a postcard from Al-Aqsa.
