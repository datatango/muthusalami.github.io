I was thinking of a design for a commemorative magnet for my MIAP cohort and decided on a vectorscope's signal output. For the uninitiated, a vectorscope is an instrument that measures and visualizes chrominance (color) information encoded in a video signal.

This particular signal pattern depicts the SMPTE color bar test pattern that is widely used for video calibration, per the NTSC standard. In this instance, the lines in the vectorscope measure the hue and saturation of the colors red, magenta, blue, cyan, green, and yellow in the bars.

I made slight modifications to the vectorscope's graticules to commemorate (probably) the program's most international cohort ğŸ¥³ watch out world!
