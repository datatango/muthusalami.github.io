[Orphans Film Symposium 2024](https://wp.nyu.edu/orphanfilm/){:target="\_ blank"} is around the corner and I had the wonderful opportunity to assist Professor Dan Streible to create a [landing site](https://wp.nyu.edu/orphans2024/){:target="\_ blank"} for the symposium.

The initial idea was to create a new page on the OFS' existing website, but it would limit us to its current theme. Hence, creating a separate site altogether seemed like a more appropriate option.

NYU the uses a customized WordPress ecosystem for its web publishing. We could not go with a custom theme for the new site and had to pick from NYU's offerings of stock themes. While the landing site is suppose to be simple, doing it with stock themes made it more difficult. The 'Twenty Twenty' theme was the closest to what we want and with a little CSS magic, we could remove unwanted elements that came with the theme.
