[Orphans Film Symposium 2024](https://wp.nyu.edu/orphanfilm/){:target="\_ blank"} is around the corner and I had the wonderful opportunity to assist Professor Dan Streible to create a [landing site](https://wp.nyu.edu/orphans2024/){:target="\_ blank"} for the symposium.

NYU uses WordPress ecosystem for its web publishing. The initial idea was to create a new page on OFS' existing website, but it would limit us to its current theme. Hence, creating a separate site altogether seemed like a more appropriate option.

We could not go with a custom theme and had to pick NYU's offerings. While the landing site is suppose to be simple, doing it with stock themes makes it more difficult. The 'Twenty Twenty' themes was the closest to what we want and with a little CSS magic, we could remove unwanted elements that came with the theme.
