[Orphans Film Symposium 2024](https://wp.nyu.edu/orphanfilm/){:target="\_ blank"} is around the corner and I had the wonderful opportunity to assist Professor Dan Streible to create a [landing site](https://wp.nyu.edu/orphans2024/){:target="\_ blank"} for the symposium.

The initial idea was to create a new page on the existing OFS website, but it would limit us to its current theme. Hence, creating a separate site altogether seemed like a more appropriate option.

NYU uses a customized WordPress ecosystem for its web publishing. It does not have the full suite of WordPress features hence we had to pick from NYU's offerings of stock themes. While the landing site is suppose to be simple, doing it with stock themes made it more difficult. The 'Twenty Twenty' theme was the closest to what we want and with a little CSS magic, we could remove unwanted elements that came with the theme.
