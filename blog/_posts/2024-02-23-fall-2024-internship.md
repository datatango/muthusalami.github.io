During my fall 2023 internship at Cineric, Inc., I learned the intricacies of the company's comprehensive restoration workflow, gaining knowledge in film scanning, digital imaging technology, and color and data management. Assigned to various departments, I observed and shadowed the dedicated staff involved in restoring cinematic masterpieces like Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1966).

Cineric, Inc. is a highly specialized lab with the capability to scan and restore obscure formats and severely deteriorated photographic materials. The highlight of my experience was delving into the world of wet-gate scanners, witnessing the seamless fusion of photo-chemical and digital technology. Notably, all scanners are bespoke creations by my internship supervisor, Simon Lund, the Director of Technical Operations. With 30 years of expertise, Cineric has developed its own liquid gate technology, producing custom gates to handle diverse formats. The company's commitment to innovation is evident in the construction of a dedicated scanner for 35mm paper prints. This internship has been immensely enriching, and I extend my gratitude to Simon and the entire staff for their invaluable guidance and mentorship.
